# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy is applicable to the Archivium website (hereinafter referred to as the "Website", "We", or "Us"), which was developed by Karl A Niemelae (hereinafter referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service. This service is provided "AS IS".

## Information We Collect
### User Provided Information

We acquire the information you supply, such as your username and email address, when you register an account on the Website. Registration is not mandatory. However, bear in mind that you might not be able to utilize some of the features offered by the Website unless you register an account.

### Automatically Collected Information

We collect certain information automatically, such as usage data, to help improve the user experience.

## Use of Information

We use the information we collect to manage your account, improve our services, and, if you have agreed, to communicate important updates.

## Data Sharing

We do not share user data with third parties unless marked public by the user or required by law. Aggregated and anonymized data may be used for analysis and improvement of the Website.

## Cookies

The Website uses cookies to manage user sessions. No third-party cookies are currently used.

## Opt-Out Rights

You can stop the collection of information by discontinuing the use of the Website. To fully remove your data, you can request deletion by contacting us at [contact@archivium.net](mailto:contact@archivium.net).

**Please note:** If you have contributed to collaborative works where you are not the owner, content you have created may not be deleted. However, we will remove any association between your account and the content. This ensures that shared projects remain intact.

## Data Retention Policy

We retain user-provided data as long as you maintain an account on the Website. If you request the deletion of your data, we will delete it within a reasonable period, except to comply with legal obligations. Note that some data may be necessary for the Website's core functionality.

## User Rights

Users retain full rights of the content they create, regardless of whether the content is marked as Private or Public. You may request deletion of your content by contacting us (see note in the **Opt-Out Rights** section for exceptions concerning collaborative works).

## Children

The Service Provider does not use the Website to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

The Website does not address anyone under the age of 13. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case the Service Provider discovers that a child under 13 has provided personal information, the Service Provider will immediately delete this from their servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact the Service Provider ([contact@archivium.net](mailto:contact@archivium.net)) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions.

## Security

We take reasonable precautions to protect your data â€” such as restricting server access and hashing passwords. However, no system can be fully secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

## Your Consent

By using the Website, you consent to our collection, use, and sharing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. "Processing" includes any actions we take with your data, such as storing, using, or sharing it.

## Contact us
